# Data Structure Project
## By Phạm Lê Ngọc Sơn

This project provides comprehensive implementations of fundamental data structures: Stacks and Queues, with multiple variations and practical applications. The implementations showcase different approaches and techniques for managing data using these important computer science concepts.

## Project Structure

- **Stack_1/**: Array-based stack implementation
- **Stack_2/**: Linked list-based stack implementation
- **Queue_1/**: Array-based queue implementation
- **Queue_2/**: Linked list-based queue implementation
- **tree/**: Tree data structure implementations
- **DSA/**: Additional data structures and algorithms

## Key Features

- Complete implementation of both Stack and Queue data structures
- Multiple implementation approaches (array-based and linked list-based)
- Utility functions for each data structure (insert, delete, display, etc.)
- Well-documented code with examples
- Interactive console-based interfaces for demonstration

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to any implementation directory (e.g., `cd Stack_1`)
3. Compile the main.cpp file (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o stack`)
4. Run the executable (e.g., `./stack`)

## Implementation Details

### Stack Implementations
- **Stack_1**: Array-based implementation with fixed capacity
- **Stack_2**: Dynamic linked list-based implementation

### Queue Implementations
- **Queue_1**: Array-based circular queue implementation
- **Queue_2**: Linked list-based queue implementation

## Usage Examples

Each implementation contains a main.cpp file that demonstrates how to use the data structure and its operations.
